### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Trung. I am a seasoned front-end engineer with 9 years of passion in creating experience-driven products. I am proficient in Angular, React and TypeScript development.

 I'm helping the Angular community by creating open sources and writing about interesting and useful topics. I found that there weren't many resources on building a proper real-world scale application, and that's my focus for sharing. My most notable open-source projects are:

- [spotify.trungk18.com](https://spotify.trungk18.com/)
- [jira.trungk18.com](https://jira.trungk18.com)
- [tetris.trungk18.com](https://tetris.trungk18.com)
- [github.com/angular-vietnam/100-days-of-angular](https://github.com/angular-vietnam/100-days-of-angular)

Recently, I organized [Angular Singapore](https://twitter.com/angularsg) to advocate and grow the Angular developer community in Singapore. 
If you have any questions/problems with @angular or need any other advice? Feel free to âœ… [book a FREE one-on-one meeting](https://trungk18.com/chat/)  with me. I'll try my best to help you. Thanks for visiting my Github :)
